  abstract  = "Studying human behavior is of particular interest within the
               field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) as it can provide
               insight into human performance. Prior HCI research suggests that
               mouse and keyboard monitoring may provide a more complete
               picture of user behavior under high cognitive loads like
               decision making and developing tasks. In this exploratory study
               we investigate the potential correlation between mouse
               behavioral patterns or keystroke dynamics and a set of End-User
               Development (EUD) behavioral attributes. We conduct a field test
               on 30 end-users interacting with a modern web-based EUD tool for
               the construction of simple web forms. Our findings reveal the
               existence of several significant correlations between end-users'
               behavioral attributes and mouse pattern metrics or keystroke
               dynamics during the development process. Mouse pattern metrics
               like random and straight movements, mouse hovers, etc., can be
               associated with perceived ease use, perceived usefulness,
               self-efficacy, willingness to learn or risk-perception.
               Similarly, some keystroke dynamics like key press speed and
               down-to-down time can be associated with perceived ease of use
               or self-efficacy. The findings of this work show a new
               interesting research direction and may motivate the EUD research
               community to study further the end-users' mouse and keyboard
               behavior in today's web-based EUD systems.",

  author    = "O'Reilly, Christian and Plamondon, R{\'e}jean",
  abstract  = "The main goal of this work is to determine whether a computer
               mouse can be used as a low-cost device for the acquisition of
               two-dimensional human movement velocity signals in the context
               of psychophysical studies and biomedical applications. A
               comprehensive overview of the related literature is presented,
               and the problem of characterizing mouse movement acquisition is
               analyzed and discussed. Then, the quality of velocity signals
               acquired with this kind of device is measured on horizontal
               oscillatory movements by comparing the mouse data to the signals
               acquired simultaneously by a video motion tracking system and a
               digitizing tablet. A synthesis of the information gathered in
               this work indicates that the computer mouse can be used for the
               reliable acquisition of biosignals in the context of human
               movement studies, particularly for many applications dealing
               with the velocity of the end effector of the upper limb. This
               paper concludes by discussing the possibilities and limitations
               of such use.",

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Subtle changes in cognitively demanding activities
               occur in MCI but are difficult to assess with conventional
               methods. In an exploratory study, we examined whether patterns
               of computer mouse movements obtained from routine home computer
               use discriminated between older adults with and without MCI.
               METHODS: Participants were 42 cognitively intact and 20 older
               adults with MCI enrolled in a longitudinal study of in-home
               monitoring technologies. Mouse pointer movement variables were
               computed during one week of routine home computer use using
               algorithms that identified and characterized mouse movements
               within each computer use session. RESULTS: MCI was associated
               with making significantly fewer total mouse moves (p<.01), and
               making mouse movements that were more variable, less efficient,
               and with longer pauses between movements (p<.05). Mouse movement
               measures were significantly associated with several cognitive
               domains (p's<.01-.05). DISCUSSION: Remotely monitored computer
               mouse movement patterns are a potential early marker of
               real-world cognitive changes in MCI.",
