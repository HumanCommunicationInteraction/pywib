  abstract  = "Studying human behavior is of particular interest within the
               field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) as it can provide
               insight into human performance. Prior HCI research suggests that
               mouse and keyboard monitoring may provide a more complete
               picture of user behavior under high cognitive loads like
               decision making and developing tasks. In this exploratory study
               we investigate the potential correlation between mouse
               behavioral patterns or keystroke dynamics and a set of End-User
               Development (EUD) behavioral attributes. We conduct a field test
               on 30 end-users interacting with a modern web-based EUD tool for
               the construction of simple web forms. Our findings reveal the
               existence of several significant correlations between end-users'
               behavioral attributes and mouse pattern metrics or keystroke
               dynamics during the development process. Mouse pattern metrics
               like random and straight movements, mouse hovers, etc., can be
               associated with perceived ease use, perceived usefulness,
               self-efficacy, willingness to learn or risk-perception.
               Similarly, some keystroke dynamics like key press speed and
               down-to-down time can be associated with perceived ease of use
               or self-efficacy. The findings of this work show a new
               interesting research direction and may motivate the EUD research
               community to study further the end-users' mouse and keyboard
               behavior in today's web-based EUD systems.",

               occur in MCI but are difficult to assess with conventional

               of computer mouse movements obtained from routine home computer
               use discriminated between older adults with and without MCI.
               METHODS: Participants were 42 cognitively intact and 20 older
               adults with MCI enrolled in a longitudinal study of in-home
               monitoring technologies. Mouse pointer movement variables were
               computed during one week of routine home computer use using
               algorithms that identified and characterized mouse movements
               within each computer use session. RESULTS: MCI was associated
               with making significantly fewer total mouse moves (p<.01), and
               making mouse movements that were more variable, less efficient,
               and with longer pauses between movements (p<.05). Mouse movement
               measures were significantly associated with several cognitive
               domains (p's<.01-.05). DISCUSSION: Remotely monitored computer

               computer interaction. They concluded that for intelligent
               interaction, emotions play an important role. By embedding the
               emotions in the interaction of human with machine, machine would
               be in a position to sense the mood of the user and change its

               machines. Traditionally, interactions between humans and
               machines like computers do not exhibit any emotional exchanges.
               If we could build any system that is intelligent enough to
               interact with humans that involves emotions, that is, it can
               detect user emotions and change its behaviour accordingly, then

                     application recorded keys pressed and mouse clicks.
                     Participants were asked to complete the short form of

                     both studies was relatively small. There was about 40\%

               function. Researchers have already attributed a certain amount
               of variability and ``drift'' in an individual's typing pattern
               to situational factors as well as stress, but this phenomenon
               has not been explored adequately. In an attempt to detect
               changes in typing associated with stress, this research analyzes
               keystroke and linguistic features of spontaneously generated
               text. Results show that it is possible to classify cognitive and
               physical stress conditions relative to non-stress conditions
               based on keystroke and linguistic features with accuracy rates
               comparable to those currently obtained using affective computing
               methods. The proposed approach is attractive because it requires
               no additional hardware, is unobtrusive, is adaptable to
               individual users, and is of very low cost. This research
               demonstrates the potential of exploiting continuous monitoring
               of keyboard interactions to support the early detection of
               changes in cognitive and physical function.",

  abstract  = "Movement tracking is a novel process-tracing method that
               promises unique access to the temporal dynamics of psychological
               processes. The method involves high-resolution tracking of a
               hand or handheld device (e.g., a computer mouse) while it is
               used to make a choice. In contrast to other process-tracing
               methods, which mostly focus on information acquisition, movement
               tracking focuses on the processes of information integration and
               preference formation. In this article, we present a tutorial on
               movement tracking of psychological processes with the mousetrap
               R package. We address all steps of the research process, from
               design to interpretation, with a particular focus on data
               processing and analysis and featuring both established and novel
               approaches. Using a representative working example, we
               demonstrate how the various steps of movement-tracking analysis
               can be implemented with mousetrap and provide thorough
               explanations of their theoretical background and interpretation.
               Finally, we present a list of recommendations to assist
               researchers in addressing their own research questions using
               movement tracking of psychological processes.",

  abstract  = "Mouse-tracking is an increasingly popular process-tracing
               method. It builds on the assumption that the continuity of
               cognitive processing leaks into the continuity of mouse
               movements. Because this assumption is the prerequisite for
               meaningful reverse inference, it is an important question
               whether the assumed interaction between continuous processing
               and movement might be influenced by the methodological setup of
               the measurement. Here we studied the impacts of three commonly
               occurring methodological variations on the quality of
               mouse-tracking measures, and hence, on the reported cognitive
               effects. We used a mouse-tracking version of a classical
               intertemporal choice task that had previously been used to
               examine the dynamics of temporal discounting and the date-delay
               effect (Dshemuchadse, Scherbaum, \& Goschke, 2013). The data
               from this previous study also served as a benchmark condition in
               our experimental design. Between studies, we varied the starting
               procedure. Within the new study, we varied the response
               procedure and the stimulus position. The starting procedure had
               the strongest influence on common mouse-tracking measures, and
               therefore on the cognitive effects. The effects of the response
               procedure and the stimulus position were weaker and less
               pronounced. The results suggest that the methodological setup
               crucially influences the interaction between continuous
               processing and mouse movement. We conclude that the
               methodological setup is of high importance for the validity of
               mouse-tracking as a process-tracing method. Finally, we discuss
               the need for standardized mouse-tracking setups, for which we
               provide recommendations, and present two promising lines of
               research toward obtaining an evidence-based gold standard of
               mouse-tracking.",
