  abstract  = "Studying human behavior is of particular interest within the
               field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) as it can provide
               insight into human performance. Prior HCI research suggests that
               mouse and keyboard monitoring may provide a more complete
               picture of user behavior under high cognitive loads like
               decision making and developing tasks. In this exploratory study
               we investigate the potential correlation between mouse
               behavioral patterns or keystroke dynamics and a set of End-User
               Development (EUD) behavioral attributes. We conduct a field test
               on 30 end-users interacting with a modern web-based EUD tool for
               the construction of simple web forms. Our findings reveal the
               existence of several significant correlations between end-users'
               behavioral attributes and mouse pattern metrics or keystroke
               dynamics during the development process. Mouse pattern metrics
               like random and straight movements, mouse hovers, etc., can be
               associated with perceived ease use, perceived usefulness,
               self-efficacy, willingness to learn or risk-perception.
               Similarly, some keystroke dynamics like key press speed and
               down-to-down time can be associated with perceived ease of use
               or self-efficacy. The findings of this work show a new
               interesting research direction and may motivate the EUD research
               community to study further the end-users' mouse and keyboard
               behavior in today's web-based EUD systems.",

               which helps to take not only the decisions but also to enhance
               learning, creative thinking and to effectively correspond in the
               social interaction. Several studies have been conducted
               comprising of classical human human interaction and human
               computer interaction. They concluded that for intelligent
               interaction, emotions play an important role. By embedding the
               emotions in the interaction of human with machine, machine would
               be in a position to sense the mood of the user and change its

               the user and its responses will be more similar to human
               behaviour. In general, human beings make use of emotions through
               speech, facial expression and gestures for conveying the crucial

               machines. Traditionally, interactions between humans and
               machines like computers do not exhibit any emotional exchanges.
               If we could build any system that is intelligent enough to
               interact with humans that involves emotions, that is, it can
               detect user emotions and change its behaviour accordingly, then
               using machines could be more effective and friendly. Many
               approaches have been taken to detect user emotions. Affective
               computing is the field that detects user emotion in a particular
               moment. Our approach in this paper is to detect user emotions by
               analysing the keyboard typing patterns of the user and the type
               of texts (words, sentences) typed by them. This combined
               analysis gives us a promising result showing a substantial

               with computers. We have considered seven emotional classes for
               classifying the emotional states. For text pattern analysis, we

                     explorative studies were conducted. In first study a
                     background application was executed on 20 participants'
                     computers to record keys pressed and mouse clicks on an

                     completed a programming task in an hour while a background
                     application recorded keys pressed and mouse clicks.
                     Participants were asked to complete the short form of
                     IPIP-NEO personality inventory afterwards. Pearson
                     correlation analysis was done between participants'
                     behaviour on keyboard, mouse events and personality
                     ratings. Findings/Design -- The results suggest that some
                     of the main traits and sub traits of personality can be
                     measured from keyboard and mouse use. Significant
                     correlations were found between personality main traits
                     and sub traits and the use of keyboard and mouse. The

                     both studies was relatively small. There was about 40\%
                     overlap of participants in the studies. Originality/Value

                     and behaviour and specifically on the measurement of
                     personality from the user behaviour on keyboard and mouse.

  abstract  = "Monitoring of cognitive and physical function is central to the
               care of people with or at risk for various health conditions,
               but existing solutions rely on intrusive methods that are
               inadequate for continuous tracking. Less intrusive techniques
               that facilitate more accurate and frequent monitoring of the
               status of cognitive or physical function become increasingly
               desirable as the population ages and lifespan increases. Since
               the number of seniors using computers continues to grow
               dramatically, a method that exploits normal daily computer
               interactions is attractive. This research explores the
               possibility of detecting cognitive and physical stress by
               monitoring keyboard interactions with the eventual goal of
               detecting acute or gradual changes in cognitive and physical
               function. Researchers have already attributed a certain amount
               of variability and ``drift'' in an individual's typing pattern
               to situational factors as well as stress, but this phenomenon
               has not been explored adequately. In an attempt to detect
               changes in typing associated with stress, this research analyzes
               keystroke and linguistic features of spontaneously generated
               text. Results show that it is possible to classify cognitive and
               physical stress conditions relative to non-stress conditions
               based on keystroke and linguistic features with accuracy rates
               comparable to those currently obtained using affective computing
               methods. The proposed approach is attractive because it requires
               no additional hardware, is unobtrusive, is adaptable to
               individual users, and is of very low cost. This research
               demonstrates the potential of exploiting continuous monitoring
               of keyboard interactions to support the early detection of
               changes in cognitive and physical function.",
