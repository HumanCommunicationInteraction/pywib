  abstract  = "Studying human behavior is of particular interest within the
               field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) as it can provide
               insight into human performance. Prior HCI research suggests that
               mouse and keyboard monitoring may provide a more complete
               picture of user behavior under high cognitive loads like
               decision making and developing tasks. In this exploratory study
               we investigate the potential correlation between mouse
               behavioral patterns or keystroke dynamics and a set of End-User
               Development (EUD) behavioral attributes. We conduct a field test
               on 30 end-users interacting with a modern web-based EUD tool for
               the construction of simple web forms. Our findings reveal the
               existence of several significant correlations between end-users'
               behavioral attributes and mouse pattern metrics or keystroke
               dynamics during the development process. Mouse pattern metrics
               like random and straight movements, mouse hovers, etc., can be
               associated with perceived ease use, perceived usefulness,
               self-efficacy, willingness to learn or risk-perception.
               Similarly, some keystroke dynamics like key press speed and
               down-to-down time can be associated with perceived ease of use
               or self-efficacy. The findings of this work show a new
               interesting research direction and may motivate the EUD research
               community to study further the end-users' mouse and keyboard
               behavior in today's web-based EUD systems.",
